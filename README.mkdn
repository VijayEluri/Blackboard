# Blackboard

Blackboard is a simplistic generic event system.

A Notifier can fire an Event that will be heard by a Listener (or many), wherever it may be. This is very convenient in GUI-applications, where you don't want to, or even are unable to, directly connect a notifier with a listener.

## Caveats

There is no singleton mechanism built into Blackboard â€“ that has been left up to the implementor.  Instead of using a simple static final field, use a proper [ThreadLocal][tldoc] implementation. This is especially important for Java EE projects. You can find an example of its usage in this project's `example` source path.
